## Status
- Currently dogfooding.
- Major bugs have been addressed.
- Frequent breaking changes are expected.
- Memo
  - Initially, implementation via GitHub Actions was attempted, but it was found unsuitable for PR monitoring, leading to a migration to the Python version.
  - The Python version monitors user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users and performs notifications and actions based on the PR's phase.

## Overview

This Python tool monitors the phases of Pull Requests where GitHub Copilot performs automated implementations, executing notifications and actions at appropriate times.
It efficiently monitors PRs in user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users by utilizing the GraphQL API.

## Features

- **Automatic Monitoring of All Repositories**: Automatically monitors PRs in user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users.
- **Leveraging GraphQL API**: Achieves fast monitoring with efficient data retrieval.
- **Phase Detection**: Automatically determines PR status (phase1: Draft state, phase2: Addressing review comments, phase3: Awaiting review, LLM working: Coding agent in progress).
- **Dry-run Mode**: By default, it only monitors and does not execute actual actions (comment posting, making PR Ready, sending notifications). It can be safely operated by explicitly enabling these actions.
- **Automatic Comment Posting**: Automatically posts appropriate comments based on the phase (requires enabling in the configuration file).
- **Automatic Draft PR Readying**: Automatically changes Draft PRs to a Ready state to address review comments in phase2 (requires enabling in the configuration file).
- **Mobile Notifications**: Uses ntfy.sh to send notifications to mobile devices when phase3 (awaiting review) is detected (requires enabling in the configuration file).
  - Notifies when individual PRs enter phase3.
  - Also notifies when all PRs enter phase3 (message configurable in `toml`).
- **Issue List Display**: If all PRs are 'LLM working', displays the top N issues (default: 10, configurable via `issue_display_limit`) for repositories without open PRs.
- **Power Saving Mode**: Automatically extends the monitoring interval to reduce API usage when no state changes occur (configurable via `no_change_timeout` and `reduced_frequency_interval`).
- **Verbose Mode**: Displays detailed configuration information on startup and during execution to help detect configuration errors (enable with `verbose`).

## Architecture

This tool is a Python application modularized according to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

```

### Phase Detection Logic

The tool detects the following four phases:

1.  **phase1 (Draft state)**: When the PR is in Draft state and there is a review request.
2.  **phase2 (Addressing review comments)**: When `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` has posted review comments, and corrections are needed.
3.  **phase3 (Awaiting review)**: When `copilot-swe-agent` has completed corrections and is awaiting human review.
4.  **LLM working (Coding agent in progress)**: When none of the above apply (e.g., Copilot is currently implementing).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x is installed.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated.
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  ```

### Setup

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-github-watcher.git
    cd cat-github-watcher
    ```

2.  Create a configuration file (optional):
    ```bash
    cp config.toml.example config.toml
    ```

3.  Edit `config.toml` to configure monitoring interval, execution mode, ntfy.sh notifications, Copilot auto-assignment, and auto-merging (optional):
    ```toml
    # Check interval (e.g., "30s", "1m", "5m", "1h", "1d")
    interval = "1m"
    
    # Maximum number of issues to display from repositories without PRs
    # Default is 10, but can be changed to any positive number (e.g., 5, 15, 20)
    issue_display_limit = 10
    
    # Timeout duration for no state change
    # If the state of all PRs (phase of each PR) does not change for this duration,
    # the monitoring interval will switch to power-saving mode (reduced_frequency_interval below).
    # Set to an empty string "" to disable.
    # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
    # Default: "30m" (30 minutes - stability priority)
    no_change_timeout = "30m"
    
    # Monitoring interval in power-saving mode
    # If no state changes are detected during the no_change_timeout period,
    # the monitoring interval switches to this interval to reduce API usage.
    # It reverts to the normal monitoring interval when a change is detected.
    # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
    # Default: "1h" (1 hour)
    reduced_frequency_interval = "1h"
    
    # Verbose mode - displays detailed configuration information
    # When enabled, all settings are displayed at startup, and repository-specific settings
    # are also shown during execution. Helps in detecting configuration errors.
    # Default: false
    verbose = false
    
    # Execution control flags - only configurable within [[rulesets]] sections
    # Global flags are no longer supported.
    # Use 'repositories = ["all"]' to apply settings to all repositories.
    
    # Example ruleset configuration:
    # [[rulesets]]
    # name = "Default for all repositories - dry-run mode"
    # repositories = ["all"]  # "all" matches all repositories
    # enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false  # set to true to ready draft PRs
    # enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false  # set to true to post phase2 comments
    # enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = false  # set to true to send ntfy notifications
    # enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = false   # set to true to merge phase3 PRs
    
    # [[rulesets]]
    # name = "Simple: Auto-assign good first issue to Copilot"
    # repositories = ["my-repo"]
    # assign_good_first_old = true  # This is enough! No [assign_to_copilot] section needed
    #                               # Default behavior: Opens issue in browser for manual assignment
    
    # ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
    # Notifications include clickable action buttons to open the PR.
    [ntfy]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
    topic = "<Enter your ntfy.sh topic name here>"  # Make it an unguessable string as anyone can read/write to it
    message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template
    priority = 4  # Notification priority (1=lowest, 3=default, 4=high, 5=highest)
    all_phase3_message = "All PRs are now in phase3 (ready for review)"  # Message when all PRs enter phase3
    
    # Phase3 auto-merge settings (optional)
    # Automatically merges the PR when it reaches phase3 (awaiting review).
    # Before merging, the comment defined below will be posted to the PR.
    # After a successful merge, the feature branch will be automatically deleted.
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # It must be explicitly enabled by specifying enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true in rulesets for each repository.
    [phase3_merge]
    comment = "All checks passed. Merging PR."  # Comment to post before merging
    automated = false  # Set to true for browser automation to click the merge button
    wait_seconds = 10  # Waiting time (in seconds) after browser launch, before clicking the button
    debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory to save debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
    
    # Auto-assign issue to Copilot (completely optional! this entire section is optional)
    # 
    # Simple usage: Just set assign_good_first_old = true in rulesets (see example above).
    # Define this section ONLY if you want to customize the default behavior.
    # 
    # Assignment behavior is controlled by ruleset flags:
    # - assign_good_first_old: Assigns the oldest "good first issue" (by issue number, default: false)
    # - assign_old: Assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, label agnostic, default: false)
    # If both are true, "good first issue" is prioritized.
    # 
    # Default behavior (if this section is not defined):
    # - Automatically clicks button with browser automation
    # - Uses PyAutoGUI
    # - wait_seconds = 10
    # 
    # Required: PyAutoGUI installation is necessary (pip install pyautogui pillow)
    # 
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # It must be explicitly enabled by specifying assign_good_first_old or assign_old in rulesets for each repository.
    [assign_to_copilot]
    wait_seconds = 10  # Waiting time (in seconds) after browser launch, before clicking the button
    debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory to save debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
    ```

4.  **Prepare Button Screenshots (for automation only)**:
    
    If you use automation features (enabling `automated = true` or `assign_to_copilot` / `phase3_merge`), you will need screenshots of the buttons that PyAutoGUI will click.
    
    **Required Screenshots:**
    
    For automatic issue assignment (`assign_to_copilot` feature):
    - `assign_to_copilot.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign to Copilot" button.
    - `assign.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign" button.
    
    For automatic PR merging (if `automated = true` in `phase3_merge` feature):
    - `merge_pull_request.png` - Screenshot of the "Merge pull request" button.
    - `confirm_merge.png` - Screenshot of the "Confirm merge" button.
    - `delete_branch.png` - Screenshot of the "Delete branch" button (optional).
    
    **How to Take Screenshots:**
    
    a. Open a GitHub issue or PR in your browser.
    b. Locate the button you want to automate.
    c. Take a screenshot of **only the button** (not the entire screen).
    d. Save it as a PNG file in the `screenshots` directory.
    e. Use the exact filenames listed above.
    
    **Tips:**
    - Ensure screenshots contain only the button, with a small margin.
    - Use your OS's screenshot tool (Windows: Snipping Tool, Mac: Cmd+Shift-4).
    - Make sure the button is clearly visible and not obscured.
    - If the button's appearance changes (e.g., due to theme changes), you'll need to update the screenshots.
    - Adjust the `confidence` setting if needed for image recognition (due to DPI scaling or themes).
    
    **Automatic Saving of Debug Information:**
    - If image recognition fails, debug information is automatically saved.
    - Save location: `debug_screenshots/` directory (default).
    - Saved content:
      - Screenshot (full screen at time of failure): `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.png`
      - Failure information JSON: `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.json`
        - Button name, timestamp, confidence threshold, screenshot path, template image path.
    - The debug directory can be changed in the settings: `debug_dir` option (within the `assign_to_copilot` or `phase3_merge` sections).
    
    **Important Requirements:**
    - You must be **already logged into GitHub** in your default browser.
    - Automation uses existing browser sessions (no new authentication is performed).
    - Ensure the correct GitHub window/tab is focused and visible on screen when a button is to be clicked.
    - If multiple GitHub pages are open, the first found button will be clicked.
    
    **Create Screenshots Directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir screenshots
    ```

5.  Install PyAutoGUI (for automation only):
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-automation.txt
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    pip install pyautogui pillow
    ```

### Execution

Start the tool to begin monitoring:

```bash
python3 cat-github-watcher.py [config.toml]
```

Alternatively, run directly as a Python module:

```bash
python3 -m src.gh_pr_phase_monitor.main [config.toml]
```

### Operational Flow

1.  **Startup**: When the tool starts, it begins monitoring user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users.
2.  **PR Detection**: Automatically detects repositories with open PRs.
3.  **Phase Determination**: Determines the phase of each PR (phase1/2/3, LLM working).
4.  **Action Execution**:
    - **phase1**: Dry-run by default (if `enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true` in rulesets, changes Draft PR to Ready state).
    - **phase2**: Dry-run by default (if `enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true` in rulesets, posts a comment requesting Copilot to apply changes).
    - **phase3**: Opens the PR page in the browser.
      - If `enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true` in rulesets, also sends ntfy.sh notification.
      - If `enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true` in rulesets, automatically merges the PR (using global `[phase3_merge]` settings).
    - **LLM working**: Waits (if all PRs are in this state, displays issues for repositories without open PRs).
5.  **Automatic Issue Assignment**: If all PRs are 'LLM working' AND there are repositories without open PRs:
    - If `assign_good_first_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest "good first issue" (by issue number).
    - If `assign_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, label agnostic).
    - If both are true, "good first issue" is prioritized.
    - Default behavior: PyAutoGUI automatically clicks the button (the `[assign_to_copilot]` section is optional).
    - Required: PyAutoGUI installation and button screenshot preparation are necessary.
6.  **Repetition**: Continues monitoring at the configured interval.
    - If no state changes are detected for the duration configured by `no_change_timeout`, it automatically switches to power-saving mode (`reduced_frequency_interval`) to reduce API usage.
    - When a change is detected, it reverts to the normal monitoring interval.

### Dry-run Mode

By default, the tool operates in **Dry-run Mode** and does not execute actual actions. This allows you to safely verify its operation.

- **Phase1 (Draft → Ready)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would mark PR as ready for review` but does not actually perform the action.
- **Phase2 (Comment Posting)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would post comment for phase2` but does not actually perform the action.
- **Phase3 (ntfy Notification)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would send ntfy notification` but does not actually perform the action.
- **Phase3 (Merge)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would merge PR` but does not actually perform the action.

To enable actual actions, set the following flags to `true` in the `[[rulesets]]` section of `config.toml`:
```toml
[[rulesets]]
name = "Enable automation for specific repositories"
repositories = ["test-repo"]  # Or ["all"] for all repositories
enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true  # Make Draft PR ready
enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true  # Post Phase2 comment
enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true  # Send ntfy notification
enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true   # Merge Phase3 PR
assign_good_first_old = true              # Auto-assign good first issue
```

### Stopping

You can stop monitoring with `Ctrl+C`.

## Notes

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
- This tool assumes integration with GitHub Copilot (specifically `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` and `copilot-swe-agent`).
- **Only user-owned repositories** of the authenticated user are monitored. Organization repositories are not included to keep the tool simple and focused (YAGNI principle).
- Be aware of API rate limits, as it uses the GraphQL API.
- If using ntfy.sh notifications, configure a topic on [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) beforehand.
