## Current Status

**Python version development is complete and currently in operation.**

Initially, we attempted implementation with GitHub Actions, but it was found to be unsuitable for PR monitoring, so we migrated to a Python version.
The Python version monitors all repositories of an authenticated GitHub user and performs notifications and actions according to the PR phase.

## Overview

This Python tool monitors the phases of PRs where GitHub Copilot performs automated implementation, executing appropriate notifications and actions at the right time.
It efficiently monitors PRs across all repositories of an authenticated GitHub user using the GraphQL API.

## Features

- **Automatic Monitoring of All Repositories**: Automatically monitors PRs in all repositories of an authenticated GitHub user.
- **Leveraging GraphQL API**: Achieves high-speed monitoring through efficient data retrieval.
- **Phase Detection**: Automatically determines the PR state (phase1: Draft status, phase2: Addressing review comments, phase3: Awaiting review, LLM working: Coding agent working).
- **Automatic Comment Posting**: Automatically posts appropriate comments based on the phase.
- **Automatic Readying of Draft PRs**: Automatically changes Draft PRs to a Ready state for addressing review comments in phase2.
- **Mobile Notifications**: Uses ntfy.sh to notify mobile devices when phase3 (awaiting review) is detected.
- **Issue Listing**: If all PRs are "LLM working", displays the top 10 issues from repositories with no open PRs.

## Architecture

This tool is a Python application modularized according to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

```

### Phase Detection Logic

The tool detects the following four phases:

1.  **phase1 (Draft status)**: The PR is in Draft status and has review requests.
2.  **phase2 (Addressing review comments)**: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` has posted review comments, and changes are needed.
3.  **phase3 (Awaiting review)**: `copilot-swe-agent` has completed changes, and the PR is awaiting human review.
4.  **LLM working (Coding agent working)**: Does not fall into any of the above (e.g., Copilot is implementing changes).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x is installed.
-   GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated.
    ```bash
    gh auth login
    ```

### Setup

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cat2151/gh-pr-phase-monitor.git
    cd gh-pr-phase-monitor
    ```

2.  Create a configuration file (optional):
    ```bash
    cp config.toml.example config.toml
    ```

3.  Edit `config.toml` to set the monitoring interval and ntfy.sh notifications (optional):
    ```toml
    # Check interval ("30s", "1m", "5m", "1h", "1d", etc.)
    interval = "1m"
    
    # ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
    # Notifications include a clickable action button to open the PR
    [ntfy]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
    topic = "gh-pr-phase-monitor"  # ntfy.sh topic name
    message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template
    priority = 4  # Notification priority (1=lowest, 3=default, 4=high, 5=highest)
    ```

### Execution

Start the tool to begin monitoring:

```bash
python3 gh-pr-phase-monitor.py [config.toml]
```

Or, run directly as a Python module:

```bash
python3 -m src.gh_pr_phase_monitor.main [config.toml]
```

### Workflow

1.  **Start**: When the tool starts, it begins monitoring all repositories of the authenticated GitHub user.
2.  **PR Detection**: Automatically detects repositories with open PRs.
3.  **Phase Determination**: Determines the phase of each PR (phase1/2/3, LLM working).
4.  **Action Execution**:
    -   **phase1**: Does nothing (waits in Draft state).
    -   **phase2**: Changes the Draft PR to a Ready state and posts a comment requesting Copilot to apply changes.
    -   **phase3**: Notifies of review pending (mobile notification if ntfy.sh is configured, opens PR page in browser).
    -   **LLM working**: Waits (if all PRs are in this state, displays issues from repositories with no open PRs).
5.  **Repeat**: Continues monitoring at the configured interval.

### Stopping

You can stop monitoring by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

## Important Notes

-   GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
-   Assumes integration with GitHub Copilot (specifically `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` and `copilot-swe-agent`).
-   **All repositories** accessible by the authenticated user are subject to monitoring.
-   Be mindful of API rate limits as it uses the GraphQL API.
-   If using ntfy.sh notifications, configure a topic on [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) beforehand.

## Testing

The project includes a test suite using pytest:

```bash
