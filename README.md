## Status
- Currently dogfooding.
- Major bugs have been addressed.
- Frequent breaking changes are expected.
- Memo
  - Initially, implementation was attempted with GitHub Actions, but it was found unsuitable for PR monitoring, so it was migrated to a Python version.
  - The Python version monitors user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users and performs notifications and actions according to the PR phase.

## Overview

This is a Python tool that monitors the phases of Pull Requests where GitHub Copilot performs automated implementation, executing appropriate notifications and actions at the right time.
It efficiently monitors PRs using the GraphQL API, targeting user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users.

## Features

- **Automated Monitoring of All Repositories**: Automatically monitors PRs in user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users.
- **GraphQL API Utilization**: Achieves fast monitoring with efficient data retrieval.
- **Phase Detection**: Automatically determines PR status (phase1: Draft state, phase2: Addressing review comments, phase3: Awaiting review, LLM working: Coding agent in progress).
- **Dry-run Mode**: By default, it only monitors and does not execute actual actions (posting comments, making PRs Ready, sending notifications). Can be safely operated by explicitly enabling it.
- **Automated Comment Posting**: Automatically posts appropriate comments based on the phase (requires enablement in the configuration file).
- **Automated Draft PR Ready-up**: Automatically changes Draft PRs to Ready status for addressing review comments in phase2 (requires enablement in the configuration file).
- **Mobile Notifications**: Uses ntfy.sh to send notifications to mobile devices when phase3 (awaiting review) is detected (requires enablement in the configuration file).
  - Notifies when an individual PR enters phase3.
  - Also notifies when all PRs enter phase3 (message configurable in toml).
- **Issue List Display**: If all PRs are "LLM working", displays the top N issues for repositories with no open PRs (default: 10, configurable with `issue_display_limit`).
- **Power-saving Mode**: Automatically extends the monitoring interval to reduce API usage when there's no state change (configurable with `no_change_timeout` and `reduced_frequency_interval`).
- **Verbose Mode**: Displays detailed configuration information on startup and during execution to help detect misconfigurations (enabled with `verbose`).

## Architecture

This tool is a Python application modularized according to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

```

### Phase Detection Logic

The tool identifies the following four phases:

1. **phase1 (Draft state)**: When the PR is in Draft state and has review requests.
2. **phase2 (Addressing review comments)**: When copilot-pull-request-reviewer has posted review comments and corrections are needed.
3. **phase3 (Awaiting review)**: When copilot-swe-agent has completed corrections and is awaiting human review.
4. **LLM working (Coding agent in progress)**: When none of the above apply (e.g., Copilot is implementing).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x is installed.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated.
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  ```

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-github-watcher.git
   cd cat-github-watcher
   ```

2. Create a configuration file (optional):
   ```bash
   cp config.toml.example config.toml
   ```

3. Edit `config.toml` to configure monitoring intervals, execution modes, ntfy.sh notifications, Copilot auto-assignment, and auto-merging (optional):
   ```toml
   # Check interval (e.g., "30s", "1m", "5m", "1h", "1d")
   interval = "1m"
   
   # Upper limit on the number of issues to display from repositories without PRs
   # Default is 10, but can be changed to any positive number (e.g., 5, 15, 20)
   issue_display_limit = 10
   
   # Timeout duration for no state change
   # If the state of all PRs (each PR's phase) does not change for this duration,
   # the monitoring interval switches to power-saving mode (reduced_frequency_interval below).
   # Set to an empty string "" to disable.
   # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
   # Default: "30m" (30 minutes - stability priority)
   no_change_timeout = "30m"
   
   # Monitoring interval in power-saving mode
   # If no state change is detected during the no_change_timeout period,
   # the monitoring interval switches to this interval to reduce API usage.
   # When a change is detected, it returns to the regular monitoring interval.
   # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
   # Default: "1h" (1 hour)
   reduced_frequency_interval = "1h"
   
   # Verbose mode - display detailed configuration information
   # If enabled, all settings are displayed on startup, and per-repository settings are also displayed during execution.
   # Useful for detecting configuration errors.
   # Default: false
   verbose = false
   
   # Execution control flags - only configurable within the [[rulesets]] section
   # Global flags are no longer supported
   # To apply settings to all repositories, use 'repositories = ["all"]'
   
   # Ruleset configuration example:
   # [[rulesets]]
   # name = "Default for all repositories - dry-run mode"
   # repositories = ["all"]  # "all" matches all repositories
   # enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false  # set to true to make draft PRs ready
   # enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false  # set to true to post phase2 comment
   # enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = false  # set to true to send ntfy notification
   # enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = false   # set to true to merge phase3 PR
   
   # [[rulesets]]
   # name = "Simple: automatically assign good first issues to Copilot"
   # repositories = ["my-repo"]
   # assign_good_first_old = true  # This is enough! The [assign_to_copilot] section is not needed.
   #                               # Default behavior: open issue in browser for manual assignment.
   
   # ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
   # Notifications include a clickable action button to open the PR.
   [ntfy]
   enabled = false  # set to true to enable notifications
   topic = "<Enter your ntfy.sh topic name here>"  # This topic can be read/written by anyone, so please use an unguessable string.
   message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template
   priority = 4  # Notification priority (1=lowest, 3=default, 4=high, 5=highest)
   all_phase3_message = "All PRs are now in phase3 (ready for review)"  # Message when all PRs enter phase3
   
   # Phase3 Auto-merge settings (optional)
   # Automatically merges the PR when it reaches phase3 (awaiting review).
   # Before merging, the comment defined below will be posted to the PR.
   # After successful merge, the feature branch will be automatically deleted.
   # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
   # You must explicitly enable it by setting enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true in the rulesets for each repository.
   # IMPORTANT: If auto-merge is enabled, the comment field must be explicitly configured.
   [phase3_merge]
   comment = "The agent determines that review comments have been addressed. Under the user's responsibility, user review will be omitted. Merging the PR."  # Comment to post before merging (required when auto-merge is enabled)
   automated = false  # set to true to click merge button via browser automation
   wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time in seconds after browser launch, before clicking the button
   debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory to save debug information on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
   
   # Automatically assign issues to Copilot (completely optional! This entire section is optional)
   # 
   # Simple usage: just set assign_good_first_old = true in rulesets (see example above)
   # Define this section only if you want to customize the default behavior.
   # 
   # Assignment behavior is controlled by ruleset flags:
   # - assign_good_first_old: Assigns the oldest "good first issue" (by issue number, default: false)
   # - assign_old: Assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, any label, default: false)
   # If both are true, "good first issue" is prioritized.
   # 
   # Default behavior (if this section is not defined):
   # - Automatically clicks buttons via browser automation
   # - Uses PyAutoGUI
   # - wait_seconds = 10
   # 
   # REQUIRED: PyAutoGUI installation is required (pip install pyautogui pillow)
   # 
   # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
   # You must explicitly enable it by specifying assign_good_first_old or assign_old in the rulesets for each repository.
   [assign_to_copilot]
   wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time in seconds after browser launch, before clicking the button
   debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory to save debug information on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
   ```

4. **Prepare Button Screenshots (only if using automation)**:
   
   If you use automation features (`automated = true` or enabling `assign_to_copilot` / `phase3_merge`),
   screenshots of the buttons PyAutoGUI needs to click are required.
   
   **Required Screenshots:**
   
   For automated issue assignment (`assign_to_copilot` feature):
   - `assign_to_copilot.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign to Copilot" button
   - `assign.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign" button
   
   For automated PR merging (if `automated = true` for `phase3_merge` feature):
   - `merge_pull_request.png` - Screenshot of the "Merge pull request" button
   - `confirm_merge.png` - Screenshot of the "Confirm merge" button
   - `delete_branch.png` - Screenshot of the "Delete branch" button (optional)
   
   **How to Take Screenshots:**
   
   a. Open a GitHub issue or PR in your browser.
   b. Find the button you want to automate.
   c. Take a screenshot of **only the button** (not the entire screen).
   d. Save it as a PNG file in the `screenshots` directory.
   e. Use the exact filenames listed above.
   
   **Tips:**
   - Screenshots should include only the button, with a small margin.
   - Use your OS's screenshot tool (Windows: Snipping Tool, Mac: Cmd+Shift+4).
   - Ensure the button is clearly visible and not obscured.
   - If the button's appearance changes (e.g., due to theme changes), you'll need to update the screenshots.
   - Use the `confidence` setting to adjust image recognition reliability (due to DPI scaling or themes).
   
   **Automated Debug Information Saving:**
   - If image recognition fails, debug information is automatically saved.
   - Save location: `debug_screenshots/` directory (default).
   - Contents saved:
     - Screenshot (full screen at time of failure): `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.png`
     - Failure information JSON: `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.json`
       - Button name, timestamp, confidence threshold, screenshot path, template image path.
   - The debug directory can be changed in the settings: `debug_dir` option (within the `assign_to_copilot` or `phase3_merge` sections).
   
   **Important Requirements:**
   - You must already be **logged in to GitHub** in your default browser.
   - Automation uses existing browser sessions (it does not perform new authentication).
   - Ensure the correct GitHub window/tab is focused and visible on screen when a button is clicked.
   - If multiple GitHub pages are open, the first found button will be clicked.
   
   **Create Screenshot Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir screenshots
   ```

5. Install PyAutoGUI (only if using automation):
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-automation.txt
   ```
   または
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogui pillow
   ```

### Run

Start the tool to begin monitoring:

```bash
python3 cat-github-watcher.py [config.toml]
```

Or, run directly as a Python module:

```bash
python3 -m src.gh_pr_phase_monitor.main [config.toml]
```

### Workflow

1. **Start**: When the tool is launched, it begins monitoring user-owned repositories of the authenticated GitHub user.
2. **PR Detection**: Automatically detects repositories with open PRs.
3. **Phase Determination**: Determines the phase of each PR (phase1/2/3, LLM working).
4. **Action Execution**:
   - **phase1**: Default is Dry-run (if `enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true` in rulesets, Draft PR is changed to Ready state).
   - **phase2**: Default is Dry-run (if `enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true` in rulesets, posts a comment asking Copilot to apply changes).
   - **phase3**: Opens the PR page in the browser.
     - If `enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true` in rulesets, also sends an ntfy.sh notification.
     - If `enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true` in rulesets, automatically merges the PR (using global `[phase3_merge]` settings).
   - **LLM working**: Waits (if all PRs are in this state, displays issues from repositories with no open PRs).
5. **Automated Issue Assignment**: If all PRs are "LLM working" and there are repositories with no open PRs:
   - If `assign_good_first_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest "good first issue" (by issue number).
   - If `assign_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, any label).
   - If both are true, "good first issue" is prioritized.
   - Default behavior: Automatically clicks buttons with PyAutoGUI (the `[assign_to_copilot]` section is not needed).
   - Required: PyAutoGUI installation and button screenshot preparation are necessary.
6. **Repeat**: Continues monitoring at the configured interval.
   - If no state change occurs for the duration set by `no_change_timeout`, it automatically switches to power-saving mode (`reduced_frequency_interval`) to reduce API usage.
   - When a change is detected, it returns to the normal monitoring interval.

### Dry-run Mode

By default, the tool operates in **Dry-run Mode** and does not execute actual actions, allowing you to safely verify its operation.

- **Phase1 (Draft → Ready-up)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would mark PR as ready for review` but does nothing.
- **Phase2 (Comment Posting)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would post comment for phase2` but does nothing.
- **Phase3 (ntfy Notification)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would send ntfy notification` but does nothing.
- **Phase3 (Merge)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would merge PR` but does nothing.

To enable actual actions, set the following flags to `true` in the `[[rulesets]]` section of `config.toml`.
```toml
[[rulesets]]
name = "Enable automation for specific repository"
repositories = ["test-repo"]  # or ["all"] for all repositories
enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true  # Make Draft PR ready
enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true  # Post Phase2 comment
enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true  # Send ntfy notification
enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true   # Merge Phase3 PR
assign_good_first_old = true              # Auto-assign good first issue
```

### Stopping

You can stop monitoring with `Ctrl+C`.

## Caveats

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
- Assumes integration with GitHub Copilot (specifically copilot-pull-request-reviewer and copilot-swe-agent).
- **Only user-owned repositories** of the authenticated user are monitored. Organization repositories are not included to keep the tool simple and focused (YAGNI principle).
- Since the GraphQL API is used, be mindful of API rate limits.
- If using ntfy.sh notifications, please configure a topic on [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) in advance.
