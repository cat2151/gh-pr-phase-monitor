## Status
- Currently dogfooding.
- Major bugs have been addressed.
- Breaking changes occur frequently.
- Notes
  - Initially, implementation was attempted with GitHub Actions, but it was found unsuitable for the purpose of PR monitoring, so it was migrated to a Python version.
  - The Python version monitors user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users and performs notifications and actions based on the PR phase.

## Overview

This is a Python tool that monitors the phases of Pull Requests where GitHub Copilot performs automated implementation, and executes notifications and actions at appropriate timings.
It efficiently monitors PRs in user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users using the GraphQL API.

## Features

- **Automatic Monitoring of All Repositories**: Automatically monitors PRs in user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users
- **Leverages GraphQL API**: Achieves high-speed monitoring through efficient data retrieval
- **Phase Detection**: Automatically determines PR status (phase1: Draft state, phase2: Addressing review comments, phase3: Awaiting review, LLM working: Coding agent at work)
- **Dry-run Mode**: By default, only monitoring is performed, and actual actions (comment posting, marking PR as Ready, sending notifications) are not executed. It can be operated safely by explicitly enabling it.
- **Automatic Comment Posting**: Automatically posts appropriate comments based on the phase (requires enablement in configuration file)
- **Automatic Draft PR Readying**: Automatically changes Draft PRs to Ready state for addressing review comments in phase2 (requires enablement in configuration file)
- **Mobile Notifications**: Notifies mobile devices via ntfy.sh when phase3 (awaiting review) is detected (requires enablement in configuration file)
  - Notifies when individual PRs enter phase3
  - Also notifies when all PRs enter phase3 (message can be configured in TOML)
- **Issue List Display**: If all PRs are "LLM working", displays the top 10 issues from repositories with no open PRs.

## Architecture

This tool is a Python application modularized according to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

```

### Phase Detection Logic

The tool identifies the following four phases:

1.  **phase1 (Draft state)**: When the PR is in Draft state and there is a review request
2.  **phase2 (Addressing review comments)**: When copilot-pull-request-reviewer posts review comments and corrections are needed
3.  **phase3 (Awaiting review)**: When copilot-swe-agent has completed corrections and is awaiting human review
4.  **LLM working (Coding agent at work)**: When none of the above apply (e.g., Copilot is implementing)

## Usage

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x is installed
-   GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated
    ```bash
    gh auth login
    ```

### Setup

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-github-watcher.git
    cd cat-github-watcher
    ```

2.  Create a configuration file (optional):
    ```bash
    cp config.toml.example config.toml
    ```

3.  Edit `config.toml` to configure monitoring interval, execution mode, ntfy.sh notifications, Copilot auto-assignment, and auto-merge (optional):
    ```toml
    # Check interval (e.g., "30s", "1m", "5m", "1h", "1d")
    interval = "1m"
    
    # Execution control flags - Can only be specified within the [[rulesets]] section
    # Global flags are no longer supported
    # To apply settings to all repositories, use 'repositories = ["all"]'
    
    # Ruleset configuration example:
    # [[rulesets]]
    # name = "Default for all repositories - dry-run mode"
    # repositories = ["all"]  # "all" matches all repositories
    # enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false  # Set to true to mark draft PRs as ready
    # enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false  # Set to true to post phase2 comments
    # enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = false  # Set to true to send ntfy notifications
    # enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = false   # Set to true to merge phase3 PRs
    # enable_assign_to_copilot = false           # Set to true to enable auto-assignment feature (uses global [assign_to_copilot] setting)
    
    # ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
    # Notifications include a clickable action button to open the PR
    [ntfy]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
    topic = "<Enter ntfy.sh topic name here>"  # Anyone can read/write to it, so use an unguessable string.
    message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template
    priority = 4  # Notification priority (1=lowest, 3=default, 4=high, 5=highest)
    all_phase3_message = "All PRs are now in phase3 (ready for review)"  # Message when all PRs enter phase3
    
    # Phase3 auto-merge settings (optional)
    # Automatically merges PRs when they reach phase3 (awaiting review)
    # Before merging, the comment defined below will be posted to the PR
    # After successful merge, the feature branch will be automatically deleted
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # You must explicitly enable it by specifying enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true in the rulesets for each repository.
    [phase3_merge]
    comment = "All checks passed. Merging PR."  # Comment to post before merging
    automated = false  # Set to true to click the merge button via browser automation
    automation_backend = "selenium"  # Automation backend: "selenium" or "playwright"
    wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time (seconds) after browser launch and before button click
    browser = "edge"  # Browser to use: Selenium: "edge", "chrome", "firefox" / Playwright: "chromium", "firefox", "webkit"
    headless = false  # Run in headless mode (do not display window)
    
    # Auto-assign "good first issue" issues to Copilot (optional)
    # If enabled, it will open the issue in a browser and prompt you to click the "Assign to Copilot" button.
    # If automated = true, it will automatically click the button via browser automation.
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # You must explicitly enable it by specifying enable_assign_to_copilot = true in the rulesets for each repository.
    [assign_to_copilot]
    assign_lowest_number_issue = false  # Set to true to assign the issue with the lowest number (regardless of "good first issue" label)
    automated = false  # Set to true to enable browser automation (requires: pip install selenium webdriver-manager or playwright)
    automation_backend = "selenium"  # Automation backend: "selenium" or "playwright"
    wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time (seconds) after browser launch and before button click
    browser = "edge"  # Browser to use: Selenium: "edge", "chrome", "firefox" / Playwright: "chromium", "firefox", "webkit"
    headless = false  # Run in headless mode (do not display window)
    ```

4.  (Optional) If using browser automation, install Selenium or Playwright:
   
    **If using Selenium:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-automation.txt
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    pip install selenium webdriver-manager
    ```
   
    Browser drivers to use:
    -   **Edge**: Built-in on Windows 10/11 (no additional installation required)
    -   **Chrome**: ChromeDriver will be downloaded automatically
    -   **Firefox**: GeckoDriver will be downloaded automatically
   
    **If using Playwright:**
    ```bash
    pip install playwright
    playwright install
    ```
   
    Playwright supports chromium, firefox, and webkit browsers.

### Execution

Start the tool to begin monitoring:

```bash
python3 cat-github-watcher.py [config.toml]
```

Or run directly as a Python module:

```bash
python3 -m src.gh_pr_phase_monitor.main [config.toml]
```

### Operation Flow

1.  **Startup**: When the tool starts, it begins monitoring user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users.
2.  **PR Detection**: Automatically detects repositories with open PRs.
3.  **Phase Determination**: Determines the phase of each PR (phase1/2/3, LLM working).
4.  **Action Execution**:
    -   **phase1**: Dry-run by default (if `enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true` in rulesets, changes Draft PRs to Ready state).
    -   **phase2**: Dry-run by default (if `enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true` in rulesets, posts a comment requesting Copilot to apply changes).
    -   **phase3**: Opens the PR page in a browser.
        -   If `enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true` in rulesets, also sends ntfy.sh notifications.
        -   If `enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true` in rulesets, automatically merges the PR (uses global `[phase3_merge]` setting).
    -   **LLM working**: Waits (if all PRs are in this state, displays issues from repositories with no open PRs).
5.  **Issue Auto-Assignment**: If all PRs are "LLM working" and there are repositories with no open PRs:
    -   If `enable_assign_to_copilot = true` in rulesets, the auto-assignment feature is enabled (uses global `[assign_to_copilot]` setting).
    -   By default, assigns issues with the "good first issue" label.
    -   If `assign_lowest_number_issue = true`, assigns the issue with the lowest number (regardless of label).
6.  **Repeat**: Continues monitoring at the configured interval.

### Dry-run Mode

By default, the tool operates in **Dry-run mode** and does not execute actual actions. This allows for safe verification of its operation.

-   **Phase1 (Draft → Ready)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would mark PR as ready for review` but does not perform any actual action.
-   **Phase2 (Comment Posting)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would post comment for phase2` but does not perform any actual action.
-   **Phase3 (ntfy Notification)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would send ntfy notification` but does not perform any actual action.
-   **Phase3 (Merge)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would merge PR` but does not perform any actual action.

To enable actual actions, set the following flags to `true` in the `[[rulesets]]` section of `config.toml`:
```toml
[[rulesets]]
name = "Enable automation for specific repositories"
repositories = ["test-repo"]  # Or ["all"] for all repositories
enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true  # Mark Draft PRs as Ready
enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true  # Post Phase2 comment
enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true  # Send ntfy notification
enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true   # Merge Phase3 PRs 
enable_assign_to_copilot = true           # Enable auto-assignment feature (uses global [assign_to_copilot] setting)
```

### Stopping

You can stop monitoring with `Ctrl+C`.

## Notes

-   GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
-   It assumes integration with GitHub Copilot (specifically copilot-pull-request-reviewer and copilot-swe-agent).
-   **Only user-owned repositories** of the authenticated user are monitored. Organization repositories are not included to keep the tool simple and focused (YAGNI principle).
-   Since the GraphQL API is used, be mindful of API rate limits.
-   If using ntfy.sh notifications, configure a topic on [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) beforehand.

## Testing

The project includes a test suite using pytest:
