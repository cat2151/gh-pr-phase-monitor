## Current Status
- Currently dogfooding.
- Major bugs have been addressed.
- Frequent breaking changes are expected.
- Memo
  - Initially, we attempted to implement this with GitHub Actions, but it was found unsuitable for PR monitoring, so we transitioned to a Python version.
  - The Python version monitors user-owned repositories for authenticated GitHub users and performs notifications and actions based on the PR's phase.

## Overview

This Python tool monitors the phases of Pull Requests (PRs where GitHub Copilot performs automated implementation) and executes appropriate notifications and actions at the right time.
It targets user-owned repositories for authenticated GitHub users and efficiently monitors PRs using the GraphQL API.

## Features

- **Automated Monitoring of All Repositories**: Automatically monitors PRs in user-owned repositories for authenticated GitHub users.
- **GraphQL API Utilization**: Achieves fast monitoring through efficient data retrieval.
- **Phase Detection**: Automatically determines the PR's status (phase1: Draft state, phase2: Addressing review comments, phase3: Waiting for review, LLM working: Coding agent at work).
- **Dry-run Mode**: By default, only monitoring is performed, and actual actions (comment posting, marking PR as Ready, sending notifications) are not executed. It can be safely operated by explicitly enabling these actions.
- **Automated Comment Posting**: Automatically posts appropriate comments based on the phase (requires enablement in the configuration file).
- **Automated Draft PR Readying**: Automatically changes Draft PRs to a Ready state for addressing review comments in phase2 (requires enablement in the configuration file).
- **Mobile Notifications**: Uses ntfy.sh to send mobile notifications when phase3 (waiting for review) is detected (requires enablement in the configuration file).
- **Issue List Display**: If all PRs are "LLM working," displays the top 10 issues from repositories without open PRs.

## Architecture

This tool is a modularized Python application adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

```

### Phase Detection Logic

The tool detects the following four phases:

1.  **phase1 (Draft state)**: When the PR is in a Draft state and has review requests.
2.  **phase2 (Addressing review comments)**: When `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` has posted review comments and corrections are needed.
3.  **phase3 (Waiting for review)**: When `copilot-swe-agent` has completed corrections and is waiting for human review.
4.  **LLM working (Coding agent at work)**: When none of the above apply (e.g., Copilot is currently implementing).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x is installed.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated.
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  ```

### Setup

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-github-watcher.git
    cd cat-github-watcher
    ```

2.  Create a configuration file (optional):
    ```bash
    cp config.toml.example config.toml
    ```

3.  Edit `config.toml` to configure the monitoring interval, execution mode, ntfy.sh notifications, and Copilot auto-assignment (optional):
    ```toml
    # Check interval (e.g., "30s", "1m", "5m", "1h", "1d")
    interval = "1m"
    
    # Execution control flags - Default is Dry-run mode
    # Set to true to enable actual actions (PR readying, comment posting, notification sending)
    enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false  # Set to true to ready draft PRs
    enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false  # Set to true to post phase2 comments
    enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = false  # Set to true to send ntfy notifications
    
    # ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
    # Notifications include a clickable action button to open the PR
    [ntfy]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
    topic = "<Enter ntfy.sh topic name here>"  # Use an unguessable string as anyone can read/write
    message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template
    priority = 4  # Notification priority (1=lowest, 3=default, 4=high, 5=highest)
    
    # Auto-assign "good first issue" issues to Copilot (optional)
    # If enabled, it will open the issue in a browser and prompt you to click the "Assign to Copilot" button.
    # If automated = true, it will automatically click the button via browser automation (requires Selenium).
    [assign_to_copilot]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable auto-assignment feature
    automated = false  # Set to true to enable browser automation (requires: pip install selenium webdriver-manager)
    wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time in seconds after browser launch, before clicking the button
    browser = "edge"  # Browser to use ("edge", "chrome", "firefox")
    ```

4.  (Optional) If using browser automation, install Selenium:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-automation.txt
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    pip install selenium webdriver-manager
    ```

    Additionally, you need the driver for your chosen browser:
    -   **Edge**: Built-in on Windows 10/11 (no additional installation needed)
    -   **Chrome**: ChromeDriver will be downloaded automatically
    -   **Firefox**: GeckoDriver will be downloaded automatically
    ```

### Execution

Start the tool to begin monitoring:

```bash
python3 cat-github-watcher.py [config.toml]
```

Or, run directly as a Python module:

```bash
python3 -m src.gh_pr_phase_monitor.main [config.toml]
```

### Workflow

1.  **Start**: Upon launch, the tool begins monitoring user-owned repositories for the authenticated GitHub user.
2.  **PR Detection**: Automatically detects repositories with open PRs.
3.  **Phase Determination**: Determines the phase of each PR (phase1/2/3, LLM working).
4.  **Action Execution**:
    -   **phase1**: Default is Dry-run (`enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true` will change Draft PRs to Ready state).
    -   **phase2**: Default is Dry-run (`enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true` will post a comment asking Copilot to apply changes).
    -   **phase3**: Opens the PR page in the browser (`enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true` will also send an ntfy.sh notification).
    -   **LLM working**: Awaits (if all PRs are in this state, displays issues from repositories without open PRs).
5.  **Repeat**: Continues monitoring at the configured interval.

### Dry-run Mode

By default, the tool operates in **Dry-run mode** and does not execute actual actions. This allows for safe verification of its operation.

-   **Phase1 (Draft → Ready)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would mark PR as ready for review` but does nothing actually.
-   **Phase2 (Comment Posting)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would post comment for phase2` but does nothing actually.
-   **Phase3 (ntfy Notification)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would send ntfy notification` but does nothing actually.

To enable actual actions, set the following flags to `true` in `config.toml`:
```toml
enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true  # Ready Draft PRs
enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true  # Post Phase2 comments
enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true  # Send ntfy notifications
```

### Stopping

You can stop monitoring by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

## Notes

-   GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
-   This tool assumes integration with GitHub Copilot (specifically `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` and `copilot-swe-agent`).
-   Only **user-owned repositories** for the authenticated user are monitored. Organization repositories are not included to keep the tool simple and focused (YAGNI principle).
-   Be mindful of API rate limits when using the GraphQL API.
-   If using ntfy.sh notifications, configure a topic on [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) beforehand.

## Testing

The project includes a test suite using pytest:

```bash
