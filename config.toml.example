# GitHub PR Phase Monitor Configuration

# Check interval - how often to check the repositories
# Supported formats:
#   - "30s" = 30 seconds
#   - "1m"  = 1 minute
#   - "5m"  = 5 minutes
#   - "1h"  = 1 hour
#   - "1d"  = 1 day
interval = "1m" # default

# Note: This tool monitors user-owned repositories under the current GitHub user account
# It uses GraphQL API to efficiently fetch all repositories with open PRs
# Organization repositories are NOT included (YAGNI principle - keeping it simple)
# No need to specify repository directories!

# ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
# Sends mobile notifications when phase3 is detected
# Notifications include a clickable action button to open the PR
[ntfy]
enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
topic = "<your-ntfy.sh-topic-name>" # Use a hard-to-guess topic name for security
message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template, {url} will be replaced with PR URL
priority = 4  # Optional: notification priority (1=min, 3=default, 4=high, 5=max)
