# GitHub PR Phase Monitor Configuration

# List of repository directories to monitor
# Use absolute paths or ~ for home directory
dirs = [
    "/path/to/repo1",
    "/path/to/repo2",
    # "~/projects/my-repo",
]

# Check interval - how often to check the repositories
# Supported formats:
#   - "30s" = 30 seconds
#   - "1m"  = 1 minute
#   - "5m"  = 5 minutes
#   - "1h"  = 1 hour
#   - "1d"  = 1 day
interval = "1m"

# Phase 3 comment message - posted when copilot finishes applying changes
# Use {user} placeholder to mention the current authenticated GitHub user
# If the user cannot be determined:
#   - any "@{user}" placeholder is removed so the comment is posted without a mention
#   - any standalone "{user}" placeholder is also removed
# Default: "@{user} 🎁レビューお願いします🎁 : Copilot has finished applying the changes. Please review the updates."
phase3_comment_message = "@{user} 🎁レビューお願いします🎁 : Copilot has finished applying the changes. Please review the updates."
