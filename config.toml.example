# GitHub PR Phase Monitor Configuration

# Check interval - how often to check the repositories
# Supported formats:
#   - "30s" = 30 seconds
#   - "1m"  = 1 minute
#   - "5m"  = 5 minutes
#   - "1h"  = 1 hour
#   - "1d"  = 1 day
interval = "1m" # default

# Number of issues to display from repositories without open PRs
# Default is 10, but can be changed to any positive number (e.g., 5, 15, 20)
issue_display_limit = 10

# Note: This tool monitors user-owned repositories under the current GitHub user account
# It uses GraphQL API to efficiently fetch all repositories with open PRs
# Organization repositories are NOT included (YAGNI principle - keeping it simple)
# No need to specify repository directories!

# Execution control flags - Dry-run mode by default
# Set these to true to enable actual actions (marking PRs ready, posting comments, sending notifications)
# These global flags are used when no rulesets are defined or when rulesets don't apply
enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false  # Set to true to mark draft PRs as ready
enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false  # Set to true to post phase2 comments
enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = false  # Set to true to send ntfy notifications
enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = false   # Set to true to merge phase3 PRs

# Rulesets - Fine-grained control per repository or group of repositories
# Rulesets are applied in order, with later rulesets overriding earlier ones
# Each ruleset can specify different execution settings for different repositories
#
# Example configurations:
#
# [[rulesets]]
# name = "All repositories default"
# repositories = ["all"]  # "all" matches all repositories
# enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false
# enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false
# enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = false
# enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = false
#
# [[rulesets]]
# name = "Enable automation for test repository"
# repositories = ["owner/test-repo"]  # Specific repository with owner/name format
# enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true
# enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true
# enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true
# enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true
#
# [[rulesets]]
# name = "Enable only notifications for production repos"
# repositories = ["owner/prod-repo1", "owner/prod-repo2"]  # Multiple repositories
# enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false
# enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false
# enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true
# enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = false
#
# You can also use just the repository name without the owner (matches any owner):
# [[rulesets]]
# name = "Example with repo name only"
# repositories = ["my-repo"]  # Matches any owner/my-repo
# enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true
# enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true

# ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
# Sends mobile notifications when phase3 is detected
# Notifications include a clickable action button to open the PR
[ntfy]
enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
topic = "<your-ntfy.sh-topic-name>" # Use a hard-to-guess topic name for security
message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template, {url} will be replaced with PR URL
priority = 4  # Optional: notification priority (1=min, 3=default, 4=high, 5=max)

# Phase3 merge settings (optional)
# Automatically merge PRs when they reach phase3 (ready for review)
# Before merging, a comment defined below will be posted to the PR
[phase3_merge]
enabled = false  # Set to true to enable automatic merging (also requires enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true)
comment = "All checks passed. Merging PR."  # Comment to post before merging
automated = false  # Set to true to use browser automation to click the merge button
automation_backend = "selenium"  # Backend to use: "selenium" or "playwright" (automated mode only)
wait_seconds = 10  # How long to wait after opening the browser before clicking (automated mode only)
browser = "edge"  # Browser to use: Selenium: "edge", "chrome", "firefox" / Playwright: "chromium", "firefox", "webkit"
headless = false  # Run browser in headless mode (no visible window, automated mode only)

# Auto-assign "good first issue" issues to Copilot (optional)
# When enabled, the tool will automatically open the issue in your browser.
# You can then manually click the "Assign to Copilot" button on the GitHub issue page.
# 
# Automated mode (requires Selenium or Playwright):
# If 'automated' is set to true, the tool will use browser automation to
# automatically click the buttons after waiting for the specified time.
# 
# Selenium backend:
#   Install: pip install selenium webdriver-manager
#   Browsers: "edge", "chrome", or "firefox"
# 
# Playwright backend:
#   Install: pip install playwright && playwright install
#   Browsers: "chromium", "firefox", or "webkit"
[assign_to_copilot]
enabled = false  # Set to true to enable auto-assignment feature
automated = false  # Set to true to enable automated button clicking
automation_backend = "selenium"  # Backend to use: "selenium" or "playwright"
wait_seconds = 10  # How long to wait after opening the browser before clicking (automated mode only)
browser = "edge"  # Browser to use: Selenium: "edge", "chrome", "firefox" / Playwright: "chromium", "firefox", "webkit"
headless = false  # Run browser in headless mode (no visible window, automated mode only)
